# 🛠️ Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Practice Folder** – a collection of exercises, experiments, and notes while I study at [42](https://42.fr).  
This repo serves as a sandbox to improve skills in:

- **C programming** (libft, memory functions, system calls, etc.)
- **Bash / Zsh scripting** (automation, aliases, system administration)
- **System administration & cybersecurity basics**
- **DevOps experiments** (Git workflows, Makefiles, Docker, networking)

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Reinforce **low-level programming** (C standard library reimplementation)
- Build strong **command-line** and **scripting** habits
- Explore **networking and security** concepts
- Keep track of **progress at 42** and beyond
